 Commits all changes made to the repository since the last commit. A comment is required for every commit. It may either be supplied via the \-m option for simple comments or if the \-m option is omitted, whatever editor is specified in the EDITOR environment variable will be launched. If no editor is specified, vi is the default in all unixy environments (including OS X and cygwin) and Notepad is the default in Windows. In the editor, a comment may be added at the top, and file changes which the user does not wish to have in a given changeset can be removed by deleting them from the "### files" list at the bottom (although merging cannot be avoided through deleting things from the "### merge files" list). Every commit creates a changeset. If there are changes since the last update, files will be merged. In the event of unresolved conflicts, the user will be prompted to resolve them.

 forces commit to not make a new changeset.

This is not the recommended way to commit changes to normal servers. In general, if one wishes to commit changes committed offline without committing new changes, one should commit and changeset with all the files in the ""### files"" list removed.
